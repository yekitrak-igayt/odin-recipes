        <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>

                Bhindi is one of those rare green vegetables loved by almost everyone.  
                Prepared with a mild, spiced tempering, it's one of the quickest sabzis 
                to whip up and a staple in many Indian kitchens. You can choose to make  
                it dry or with gravy, depending on whether you're serving it with rice or  
                rotiâ€”it's totally up to you!
