        <h2 class="title">Description</h2>
            <p> Kadhi is prepared in various ways across North and Western Indian cuisines. 
                While the choice of spices and herbs may vary by region, the base remains consistentâ€”a yogurt sauce thickened with gram flour, known as besan in Hindi.
                Besan, made from skinned black chickpeas, adds a distinctive nutty flavor. 
                Traditionally, sour curd is used in kadhi, giving the dish its signature tangy, spiced, and creamy taste.
