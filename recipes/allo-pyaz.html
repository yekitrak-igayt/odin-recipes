            <p>
                
                Aloo Pyaaz Paratha is a popular North Indian comfort food that combines the warmth of 
                mashed potatoes with the crunch of finely chopped onions, all seasoned with spices like 
                cumin, coriander, and garam masala. This tasty filling is wrapped in whole wheat dough,  
                rolled into thin discs, and cooked until golden and crispy on a griddle or tawa. 
                Served hot, these parathas are often paired with tangy pickle, creamy yogurt, or  
                a dollop of fresh butter, making it a satisfying dish for any time of the day.
